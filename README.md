### Dev Notes

- The project uses a line length of 120 characters
- The code can ideally be re-used for any conference that uses the Sessionize API
- The base url for the Sessionize API for Fluttercon has been gitignored. To run the app and see conference data, switch
  to the [not-for-prod/mock-api-response](https://github.com/rohan20/fluttercon/tree/not-for-prod/mock-api-response)
  branch that uses hardcoded Fluttercon 2023 responses instead.
